        <p class="bottom-half-p">Hey everyone! I'm excited to share this instructable with you, offering a fun way to
          breathe new life into two old t-shirts and create a fresh look. Whether you're a seasoned DIY enthusiast or
          trying this out for the first time, I welcome any feedback to improve clarity and ease of understanding. Let's
          get started and unleash our creativity together!</p>
        <h2 class="bottom-half-h2">MATERIALS NEEDED:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 old t-shirts</li>
          <li>Pair of scissors</li>
          <li>Sewing machine</li>
          <li>Pins (for holding material together)</li>
          <li>A hooded shirt (to use for the pattern of the hood)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 1: Old T-shirts</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">First thing you want to do is find two old t-shirts that you don't mind cutting
          up and putting together to create a new look.Next is to figure out which t-shirt you would like to use as
          the base for your hoodie-T and which one you would like to use for the hood and sleeve ends. For my base
          shirt I used an old shirt I got when I was on holiday in Hawaii. (It was originally dark blue but I decided to
          bleach it to make it a much lighter sky blue. This is not something you need to do with your shirt unless you
          want to.) For the hood and sleeve end parts of the shirt I used a shirt which I had tye-dyed for a Homecoming
          event at my University. ( I made the mistake of picking up a pack of V-neck t-shirts instead of the crew neck
          ones. Not something I would really wear.)</p>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 2: Tracing</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">Start by laying your hoodie or sleeve shirt flat on a countertop. Then, position
          the hood of your actual hoodie on top of the shirt. Use a pen to outline the shape of the hood onto the shirt,
          leaving a half-inch allowance between the pen line and the hood for sewing seams.

          When cutting out your pattern, aim to align the part of the hood where your face goes through with the bottom
          hem of the t-shirt. This ensures that the hood will already have a hemline when finished, saving you from
          sewing it separately.

          Additionally, if you plan to continue with the sleeve part of the project, make sure to center the hood
          pattern in the middle of the shirt to avoid cutting into the sides of your hoodie or sleeve shirt. This
          ensures that the integrity of the garment remains intact..</p>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 3: Cut Cut Cut!</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">After tracing the hood onto your t-shirt, grab a pair of sharp scissors and
          carefully cut along the outlined line. Ensure you cut through both layers of the t-shirt to avoid the need to
          repeat the tracing and cutting process on the other side.

          Don't stress about achieving perfection—this is a fun refashion project! Simply do your best to reinvent an
          old shirt rather than discarding it. Remember, it's all about trial and error, so embrace the creative
          process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 4: Sewing</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">In the final picture, you'll see the completed result of sewing the hood pieces
          together. To achieve this, simply pin the two pieces together and sew a stitch along the curved part of the
          hood, using an extra hoodie as a reference if available.

          Once sewn, turn the hood right side out, revealing how it will look on the shirt at the end of the project.

          If your shirt had a pattern before you cut it, you'll need to take the pieces, once cut, and flip them so they
          match up in size and shape, with the pattern sides facing each other. For example, if your shirt had heart
          patterns on both the front and back, after cutting the pattern out, flip the pieces so the hearts are
          touching. This will leave the outside part without the pattern (or a much more subtle version of it).

          If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to send me a message—I'm here to help!

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 5: Cut Collar Off of Base Shirt</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">In this step, you'll take your base shirt and, as the name suggests, cut off the
          collar. Aim to keep the cut right below the hem, ensuring you don't cut down much farther than that. This will
          give your shirt a refreshed look without altering its overall shape too drastically.
        </p>
        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 6: The Most Confusing Part!</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">This step can be a bit tricky to visualize, so bear with me as I guide you
          through it.
          First, turn your base shirt inside out.
          Next, turn your hood piece right side out, so it looks like a normal hood with the sewn edge of the fabric on
          the inside.
          Now, take the bottom edge of the hood, which is facing right side out, and align it with the open edge of the
          collar on the backside of the shirt (the side where the collar would run along your back if you were wearing
          it). Start by lining it up along the backside of the shirt, then continue along the front collar, ensuring
          that the bottom edge of the hood lines up along the top edge of the open collar.
          Don't worry if the hood doesn't meet all the way in the front.
          Next, while keeping the two edges lined up together, push the hood down into the opening of the collar so it
          turns inside out. This will create a bowl-like appearance when looking down at it, with the seam and open ends
          of the fabric visible.
          Now, use pins to secure the two edges together.
          Take the pinned garment to your sewing machine and sew the edges together. It doesn't have to be technically
          perfect, but try to keep the seam somewhat close to the edge. A 1/4 inch seam from the end usually works well.
          Ensure the seam on the hood lines up with the middle of the back collar of the shirt. An easy way to do this
          is to fold the shirt backward in half and line up the seam with the midpoint. Then, pin outward from there.
        </p>
        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 7: Hood Attached!</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">When you are finished sewing trim the long threads and flip your shirt inside
          out.
        </p>
        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 8: New Sleeves?</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">To add a unique touch to the shirt and make it stand out even more, I decided to
          enhance the sleeve edges using the remaining fabric from the hoodie/sleeve shirt.

          Begin by laying out the hoodie/sleeve shirt flat, making sure the area where the hood pattern was removed is
          clearly visible.

          Now, take your base shirt and place the edge of its sleeve alongside the edge of the hoodie/sleeve shirt,
          ensuring that the edges are lined up with each other. This will allow you to seamlessly integrate the fabric
          from the hoodie/sleeve shirt onto the sleeves of the base shirt for added flair.
        </p>
        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 9: Attach New Sleeve End to Base Shirt</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">Now that we have out fabric cut out we need to attach it to our base
          shirt. Simply take one end of the strip and attach it to the bottom side of the base shirt and pin. Now wrap
          the fabric around the sleeve pinning it as you go. Now all you have to do is run a stitch along the inside
          of the sleeve where we can see the pins lining up. As well as another stitch a little further out to secure
          middle of the strip to the old sleeve. It makes the sleeve a little stronger and less likely to tear off.
