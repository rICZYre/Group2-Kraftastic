          useful items, thereby reducing waste and environmental impact. It involves finding innovative uses for
          post-consumer leftovers, such as glass jars, old pallets, and junk mail. Upcycling is both a practical
          solution and a source of enjoyment, challenging individuals to discover the hidden potential in everyday
          objects. Whether through crafting, DIY projects, or artistic endeavors, upcyclers breathe new life into

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 1: Precut Your Denim and Shred Paper.</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">To prepare denim for paper making, it's essential to cut it into small pieces
          using fabric scissors, ensuring they are as tiny as possible to prevent blender mishaps. Additional paper
          making tools are necessary to thoroughly break down the cotton fibers for sturdy denim paper. Incorporating
          used office paper into the denim pulp helps achieve stronger paper sheets. Remove any plastic elements from
          envelopes before adding them, and beware of sticky glue residue. A ratio of one-quarter to one-half cup of
          denim snippings to one-and-a-half to two handfuls of shredded office paper yields a pretty blue paper suitable
          for various daily tasks. Adjusting the denim-to-office paper ratio allows for customization—more denim for
          softer, thicker paper, and more office paper for sturdier, less vibrant results. Experimentation with ratios
          can achieve desired paper qualities.</p>


        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 2: Make the Pulp.</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">Add a ½ cup of salt and stir until dissolved. (Or follow the directions on the
          bottle if you’re using dye fixative.)</p>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 3: Make the Pulp.</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">
          PULPING THE DENIM<br><br>
          1. Place a very small handful of denim snippings into your blender along with four to five cups of water. (You
          might want to start with just a tablespoon's worth of denim pieces at first to see how your blender
          performs.)<br><br>
          2. Blend until the mixture is thick and pulpy. (It should be a nice shade of blue!)<br><br>
          3. Pour this liquid into your large container.<br><br>
          4. Repeat these steps, continuing to blend the remainder of the denim—one very small handful at a time—with
          four to five cups of water.<br><br>

          PULPING USED OFFICE PAPER<br><br>
          1. Place about half a cup of shredded office paper into your blender along with one teaspoon of corn starch
          and four to five cups of water. (The corn starch will help to make ink flow more smoothly onto your finished
          paper.)<br><br>
          2. Blend until the mixture is thick and pulpy. (It should look cloudy and milky-gray when it's ready.)<br><br>
          3. Pour this liquid into your large container along with the denim pulp.<br><br>
          4. Repeat these steps as needed, depending on the amount of office paper you want to mix in.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 4: ​Form Your Paper Sheets</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">The pulp level in your container should be deep enough that you can easily
          submerge your paper making mould and deckle. NOTE: If you missed this earlier, here is an Instructable for
          making your own mould and deckle. Also, some people just use window screens and picture frames to form their
          paper sheets. Whatever works!<br><br>

          1. Agitate the pulp bath with your hand to more evenly distribute its contents.<br><br>

          2. Then, holding the mould and deckle tightly together with both hands, dip it down into the container. Move
          the mould and deckle from side to side and up and down as you bring it up to the surface. This motion helps
          "lock" the paper fibers together in your sheet.<br><br>

          3. Allow excess water to drain through the screening and then place the mould and deckle upright on a rag or
          towel to catch drips.<br><br>

          4. Remove the deckle from the top of the mould. Be careful not to drip onto your wet sheet of paper, as this
          will cause weak spots and visible defects. NOTE: If you do mess up, it's no big deal. You can just invert the
          sheet back onto the surface of the pulp bath—the pulp will slide off into the liquid, and you can try
          again. (Hooray for second chances!) Place a loose sheet of screen mesh over the wet sheet of paper. Use a soft
          cloth or rag to blot excess water. Carefully remove the loose sheet of screen.<br><br>

          5. Lay one of your boards out on a flat surface. Cover with an absorbent cloth or several layers of rags and
          then invert the mould with the wet sheet of paper face down. Use another rag to blot the back of the mould's
          screen. This will help loosen the sheet enough that you should be able to transfer it from the mould onto the
          dry surface. (To help my paper dislodge from the mould and adhere to this new surface, I lightly strike the
          back of the mould with a flicking motion.)
          Now, slowly separate the mould from the paper.

        </p>
        <h2 class="steps-bottom-half-h2">Step 5: Allow to Dry</h2>
        <p class="steps-bottom-half-p">As long as your paper sheets are wet, they will be very fragile, but, once
          they're dry, they'll be nice and strong. There are many ways to dry handmade paper, and, while this one is
          pretty easy and low-tech, it isn't perfect. (Some of my sheets end up a little buckled at times, but I fix
          this by ironing them on a low setting.)
          Once you've removed the mould, make sure your wet paper is lying flat against the drying surface. Now, place
          another cloth over the top of the paper, smoothing it carefully with your hands. Continue to layer clean, dry
          cloths with all of the new, wet paper sheets you form.
          When you've finished, top with another absorbent cloth or several more layers of rags. Then place the other
          board on top. Use C-clamps to squeeze the boards tightly together. Alternatively, place a heavy weight on top
          of the boards.
          In a couple of days, you can peek at your paper. At this point, I usually replace some of the wet rags with
          dry ones and re-clamp everything. Once it's dry, you can smooth out your paper a little more by ironing it
          (without steam!) on a low setting and you can trim the edges or keep them as-is. (I like to trim mine and make
          them into handy notebooks, journals, and so on.) Ta da! You made true-blue denim paper.
